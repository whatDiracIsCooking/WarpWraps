  # --- ROCM_PRUNE on the legacy channel: the compile-only variant ------------
  #
  # ROCm installs at ~20GB. .github/workflows/images.yml builds a second tag
  # (:hip-ci) with ROCM_PRUNE=1, which brings the image to 7.05GB; the dev image
  # is untouched, since the default is off.
  #
  # IT IS AN OPTIMISATION, NOT AN ENABLER -- this comment used to claim a hosted
  # runner has "20-25GB free" and that the prune was the only way the HIP job
  # could fit. Measured on the first real run: a GitHub-hosted runner has a
  # 145GB root with 86GB free BEFORE any cleanup, so the unpruned 20.5GB image
  # would have fit comfortably. What the prune actually buys is ~13GB less to
  # pull on every CI run, and a push that takes 3 minutes instead of many.
  #
  # What comes out, measured rather than guessed (`du -x -d1 /opt/rocm/lib` plus
  # `dpkg -S` on each of the largest files):
  #
  #   4.8G  composablekernel-dev   libdevice_{gemm,conv,reduction,contraction}
  #                                _operations.a -- static archives nothing in
  #                                this tree links. Pulled in by rocm-hip-sdk.
  #   4.5G  hipblaslt/library      Tensile kernel objects, loaded at RUN time by
  #   644M  rocblas/library        libhipblaslt.so / librocblas.so. The .so files
  #   1.7G  rocfft/                themselves stay; only the kernel data goes.
  #   459M  rocalution             sparse iterative solvers; nothing here wraps
  #
  # ~12.1GB of ~20.5GB, and none of it is a link-time dependency -- which is the
  # test that decides what may go on this list. Adding anything here that a
  # hipcc link actually needs surfaces as an undefined symbol in the ci-hip
  # tier, not as a silent wrong answer, so the failure mode is at least loud.
  #
  # rccl (572M) used to be on this list -- "multi-GPU collectives; nothing here
  # wraps them". wwr.hip.rccl now wraps it (issue #100), so roc::rccl is a
  # link-time dependency of the ci-hip build and rccl/rccl-dev must STAY:
  # pruning it would fail find_package(rccl) at configure, exactly the loud
  # failure the rule above describes.
  #
  # hiptensor (226M) left this list the same way and for the same reason, and it
  # is the ONE half of the cuTENSOR/hipTensor pair that costs this image nothing
  # extra to keep -- rocm-hip-sdk already installs hiptensor-dev through
  # rocm-hip-libraries, where the CUDA side had to add a package (see
  # docker/install-cuda.sh).
  #
  # composablekernel-dev STAYS on the list even though hiptensor is built on CK:
  # what comes out is CK's static archives, which hiptensor consumed when IT was
  # compiled. Linking libhiptensor.so does not re-link them.
  #
  # Since ci-hip became a full build it also LINKS and LOADS the runtime test
  # binaries, so the SuiteListIsComplete guards now dlopen librocblas,
  # librocsolver, librocsparse and librocfft out of a pruned tree on every CI
  # run. They pass: those libraries read their kernel data lazily, on handle
  # creation, not at load. That is a stronger check of this list than the
  # compile-time tier could make.
  #
  # THE DELETION HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS SCRIPT, not in a later Dockerfile layer.
  # Layers are additive: an `rm` in a child layer hides the files but keeps their
  # bytes in the parent, and the image does not shrink at all. That is also why
  # :hip and :hip-ci cannot share the ROCm layer -- each is a full install.
  #
  # The whole packages go through apt rather than rm, so that removing one
  # something else needs FAILS here instead of at link time. They pull out the
  # rocm-hip-sdk / rocm-hip-libraries meta-packages with them, which carry no
  # files of their own. --auto-remove is deliberately NOT passed: it would widen
  # the removal to whatever else those metas were the last reference to, which is
  # exactly the kind of quiet cascade this list is written to avoid.
